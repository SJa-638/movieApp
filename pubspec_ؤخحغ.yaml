#  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
#  assets:
#    - assets/images/
#  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
#
#  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
#  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images
#
#  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
#  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
#
#  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
#  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
#  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
#  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
#  # example:
#  # fonts:
#  #   - family: Schyler
#  #     fonts:
#  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
#  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#  #         style: italic
#  #   - family: Trajan Pro
#  #     fonts:
#  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#  #         weight: 700
#  #
#  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
#  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package

#  assets:
